description: Device driver for the SESIMO FPGA CCD Sensor bridge (BOFP1)

properties:
  prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Prescaler for the timing parameters used on the FPGA. Timing parameters
      are calculated as `CLK/((PSC + 1) * DIV)`

  clock-frequency:
    type: int
    default: 100000000
    description: |
      Operating clock frequency (in Hz) for the FPGA. 

  clkdiv:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Clock divider value. The master clock frequency for the CCD is given
      by `f = clock-frequency / (25 + 100/7 * clkdiv)`

  integration-time:
    type: int
    default: 20000
    description: |
      Set integration time (in nanoseconds).
