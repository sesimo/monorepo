description: Device driver for the SESIMO FPGA CCD Sensor bridge (BOFP1)

properties:
  clock-frequency:
    type: int
    default: 100000000
    description: |
      Operating clock frequency (in Hz) for the FPGA. 

  clkdiv:
    type: int
    default: 62
    description: |
      Clock divider value. The master clock frequency for the CCD is given
      by `f = clock-frequency / clkdiv`. This can not be changed, and should
      be the same as the value used on the FPGA.

      Defaults to 62, which gives ~1.6MHz operating frequency.

  integration-time:
    type: int
    default: 20000
    description: |
      Set integration time (in nanoseconds). The integration time is determined
      by the periodicity of the SH signal on the FPGA. The frequency of this
      signal is given by `f = MCLK/((PSC+1) * (SH+1))`, that is, it is
      dependent on both the MCLK frequency and the PSC value. The integration
      time attribute only adjusts the SH value, so MCLK and PSC may need
      to be manually adjusted to obtain the best possible frequnecy.


  busy-gpios:
    description: |
      GPIO for indicating if the CCD is busy
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

  fifo-wmark-gpios:
    description: |
      FIFO watermark GPIO (more than 256 elements in the FIFO)
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

  total-avg-n:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Number of frames to capture before returning an average of all of them
      as a single frame.

  moving-avg-n:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Number of neighbours (on each side) to produce a moving average for each
      of the pixels in a frame.
