properties:
  prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Prescaler for the timing parameters used on the FPGA. Timing parameters
      are calculated as `CLK/((PSC + 1) * DIV)`

  clock-frequency:
    type: int
    default: 100000000
    description: |
      Operating clock frequency (in Hz) for the FPGA.
